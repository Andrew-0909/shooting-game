q1. This game works by the player shoots the target that is falling down. When the bullet hits a target, then player gets 1 point. Otherwise, player couldn't earn any points

q2. I especially learned the train method, classes that makes game run, and constructors to each main classes

q3. the Constructor was not that but I was bored with the changing all the codes what we have wrote in constructor part. The train method was still hard to recognize.

q4. Next time, I would add targets that change color during game and classify easy mode and hard mode.
